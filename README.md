# Data structures written in C

This is a simple library that contains different data structures written in C.

## How to build and use

 1. Clone the repository using the `git clone <repository link>`
 2. Run the make file using the `make all` command
 3. Include any data structure to your project using the appropriate header files
 4. Create the data structures using the appropriate constructors, ex:- `Dictionary dict = dictionary_constructor(COMPARE_STR_KEYS);`
 5. Compile your project as follows `gcc <your files here> libdatastructures.a`
 6. Enjoy!

## Data structures included here

 1. Linked List
 2. Queue
 3. Binary Search Tree
 4. Dictionary

## Notes
A default compare function is provided (COMPARE_STR_KEYS). But feel free to write your own compare functions to match your usecase.

The library is extremely primitive and only appropriate for educational projects and not for any commercial use.
